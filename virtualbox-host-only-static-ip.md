### VirtualBox Host-Only Static IP

My typical setup for a development box in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) uses two NICs. The first uses NAT to allow the box to communicate with the outside world through my host computerâ€™s network connection. (NAT is the default, so shouldn't require any setup.) The second is a "host-only" connection that allows my host and guest to interact.

To create a host-only connection in VirtualBox, start by opening the preferences in VirtualBox. Go to the "Network" tab, and addd a Host-only Network. Modify the host-only network, and disable DHCP. Make a note of the IP address. (Feel free to set the IP address as well, if you like.)

Next, assign this host-only adapter to the virtual machine. Select the VM and press "Settings". Go to the "Network" tab, and select "Adpater 2". Enable the adapter, set it to a "Host-only Adapter", and select the adpater you created above.

### Temporary

To get the static IP address working temporarily, access the termainal on the client, and enter the following to assign a static IP to eth1. (I'm assuming 192.168.56.101 because that's VirtualBox's default. Make sure it matches the IP for your host-only adapter.)

```bash
# On GUEST: Temporarily assign a static IP to eth1
ifconfig eth1 192.168.56.101 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
```

### Persistent

The last command should work until you have to restart the virtual machine. To make the change persistent, you'll need to modify **/etc/network/interfaces**

```bash
# On GUEST: Modify the configuration file
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

Add the following to configure eth1 to use a static IP address and come up when the system starts.

```bash
# The host-only network interface
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 192.168.56.101
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.56.0
broadcast 192.168.56.255
```

### Accessing the Guest from the Host

Finally, you'll probably want to add some names to your host machine's **/etc/hosts** file. Make sure to add each hostname you will use on your guest.

```bash
# On HOST: edit /etc/hosts
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add a line that starts with the static IP address for the guest, followered by whitespace, then each of the hostnames that should point to your guest.

```bash
# Inside /etc/hosts on your HOST
192.168.56.101 myguest.home.local www.mycoolsite.com anyother.fakesite.com
```
